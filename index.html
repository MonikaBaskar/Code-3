        <h3 class="section-title">What is State?</h3><br>
        <p class="section-text">State is a <b>JavaScript object</b> that stores a component’s dynamic data and determines the component’s behavior.Because state is dynamic, it enables a component to keep track of changing information in between renders and for it to be dynamic and interactive.</p><br>
        <p>State is similar to props but unlike props, it is private to a component and is controlled solely by the said component. In the examples from previous chapters, the behavior of components has primarily depended on the props that are passed down to them. In those cases, the components that receive the props have no control over them because props are read-only.</p>
